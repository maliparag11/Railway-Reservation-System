# Railway-Reservation-System
# CS67 DBMS Project MMIT(Lohgaon)

This project is an online railway ticket booking platform same as IRCTC. This project also consisted of a mailing feature (user get mail for booking/cancelling a ticket, email verification, tatkal booking). I have deleted all bookings and user details; you need to add them. 

**Front-end:** HTML, JavaScript,PHP, Bootstrap3,CSS 
**Backend:** MySQL 



**Remember:**
 1) **admin login:** username->parag password->paragmali11. (check .sql file for admin username and password)
 2) Before booking ticket, schedule train on that date.
 3) User can not login without mail verification.
 4) Admin can add station details and train details.
